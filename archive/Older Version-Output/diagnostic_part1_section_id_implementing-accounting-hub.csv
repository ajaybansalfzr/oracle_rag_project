Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Note: In this case, try submitting the flattening programs using the Online Mode first. If the newly inserted child account value does not appear to be included in the flattened hierarchy data, then the flattening program has to be submitted using the Force Flattening Mode , instead of Online Flattening . An issue with the incremental flattening programs can prevent them from picking up this type of hierarchy change, so full flattening can be required."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Note: Column flattening processed data is primarily relevant to Oracle Fusion Transactional Business Intelligence, but there should not be any adverse impact to run both row and column flattening processes."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Overview of Managing Tree Structures
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"A tree structure defines the hierarchy for creating trees and prescribes rules based on which trees are created, versioned, and accessed. You can associate multiple data sources with a tree structure."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,A tree is an instance of this hierarchy. Every tree structure can contain one or more trees.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"You can create tree structures specific to an application but you can share tree structures across applications. If you apply version control to the tree structure, it's carried over to the trees that are based on the tree structure. Each tree version contains at least one root node. Occasionally, a tree version may have more than one root node."

The natural account segment is mapped to the Financial Category dimension in the balances cube to enable ad hoc reporting and transactional dashboards. This functionality uses Oracle Fusion Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition to analyze and drill into expense and revenue transactions. The natural account segment label is required."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Intercompany
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Optionally, assign the segment to be used in intercompany balancing functionality. You can't use the primary balancing or natural account segments as the intercompany segment. You can assign the same values to both the primary balancing and intercompany value sets. You can also assign the same value set to the primary balancing segment and the intercompany segment. The sharing of the value set or values:"
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Enables clear visibility of the due to and due from relationships inherent in intercompany accounting across the entire organization.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Saves maintenance and ensure completeness.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"However, sharing value sets can cause problems when applying segment value security rules because the rules applied to both segments. The rules can restrict access to certain values which may complicate entering intercompany entries. For example, you might have access to company 01 at the balancing segment level but not company 02. As a result, you can't enter an intercompany entry for transactions between 01 and 02."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Scenario
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"You are creating your chart of accounts with six segments. General Ledger permits selection of up to 30 segments for your chart of accounts. You must have a minimum of three required segments, as determined by the number of required segment labels (qualifiers). Required segment labels are:"
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Primary Balancing Segment: Main balancing segment typically used to represent the company dimension of the organization. The segment set with this label can't be set with another label.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Cost Center Segment: Smallest segment of an organization for which you collect and report costs. You are required to create this segment if you're implementing Oracle Fusion Assets.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Natural Account Segment: Classification of transactions and balances according to distinct account types: asset, liability, equity, revenue, and expense accounts. The segment set with this label can't be set with another label."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"The following optional segment labels are available, and you are implementing all of them:"
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Second Balancing Segment: Used to balance transactions, as needed, by an additional dimension beyond the primary balancing segment."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Third Balancing Segment: Used to balance transactions, as needed, by an additional dimension beyond the primary and second balancing segments."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Intercompany Segment: Used to track intercompany due to and due from balances by identifying the specific trading company. The intercompany qualified segment cannot be set with any of the three balancing segment qualifiers. The values in this segment's value set must be the same as the primary balancing segment.

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,Segment Rules and Account Rules for Chart of Accounts Mapping
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,The chart of accounts mapping feature supports the ability to correlate a source chart of accounts to a target chart of accounts to allow for the processing of balances or amounts.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"Use either segment rules, account rules, or a combination of both. A chart of accounts mapping is used by the posting process in propagating transactions from the primary ledger to its secondary ledger. The mapping feature is used by both balance transfer processes for balance level secondary ledgers as well as cross ledger transfers. The balances are copied from one ledger to another ledger in both processes."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures,"You can define chart of accounts mappings using the Manage Chart of Accounts Mapping task. If youre defining mappings that include only segment rules, you can also use the Chart of Accounts Mapping Rules Import file-based data import (FBDI)."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Segment Rules,"Use segment rules to map each segment of the target chart of accounts to an account value, or to one or two segments in the source chart of accounts. You can select from among three different mapping methods:"
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Segment Rules,Assign a constant value for a segment in the target chart of accounts.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Segment Rules,Copy the value from the source segment to the corresponding target segment.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Segment Rules,"Note: To use this method, the value sets for the paired target and source segments must share identical values."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Segment Rules,Use rollup rules to aggregate one or two source segments to a corresponding target segment.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Account rules map a complete target account combination against one or more source account combinations. The source account combinations can be defined segment by segment using:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Single detail account values
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Detail account value ranges
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Parent values for primary balancing and natural account segments
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Note: When using parent values, its child values for the date effective version of the hierarchy are processed when the mapping is called."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,FAQ for Manage Chart of Accounts Mapping
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,What's the difference between mapping with segment rules and mapping with account rules?
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Segment rules map target chart of accounts segments to an account value or segment of the source account of a secondary chart of accounts. A segment is only one part of the account combination.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Account rules map a complete target account combination against one or more source account combinations.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Note: Segment and account rules can be used alone or both types of mapping rules can be used in the same mapping set.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,When do account rules override segment rules in a chart of accounts mapping?
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"You can create a chart of accounts mapping using only segment rules, only account rules, or a combination of both segment and account rules. If an overlap exists between the two types of rule, the account rule supersedes."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Segment rules are used to broadly define the relationship between two charts of accounts on a segment by segment basis. Account rules can be used to more precisely map specific source account combinations to their target accounts.

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Conversion Rate Types
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Guidelines for Creating Conversion Rate Types
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Maintain different conversion rates between currencies for the same period using conversion rate types.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,The following conversion rate types are predefined:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Spot
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Corporate
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,User
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Fixed
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"You can use different rate types for different business needs. During journal entry, the conversion rate is provided automatically based on the selected conversion rate type and currency, unless the rate type is User . For User rate types, you must enter a conversion rate. You can define additional rate types as needed. Set your most frequently used rate type as the default. Conversion rate types can't be deleted."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Assign conversion rate types to automatically populate the associated rate for your period average and period end rates for the ledger. For example, you can assign the conversion rate type of Spot to populate period average rates, and the conversion rate type of Corporate to populate period end rates. Period average and period end rates are used in translation of account balances."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Conversion rate types are used to automatically assign a rate when you perform the following accounting functions:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Convert foreign currency journal amounts to ledger currency equivalents.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Convert journal amounts from source ledgers to reporting currencies or secondary ledgers.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Run revaluation or translation processes.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"When creating conversion rates, decide whether to:"
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Enforce inverse relationships
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Select pivot currencies
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Select contra currencies
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Enable cross rates and allow cross-rate overrides
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Maintain cross-rate rules
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Enforce Inverse Relationships
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,The Enforce Inverse Relationship option indicates whether to enforce the automatic calculation of inverse conversion rates when defining daily rates. The following table describes the impact of selecting or not selecting the option.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Action Results
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Selected
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"When you enter a daily rate to convert currency A to currency B, the inverse rate of currency B to currency A is automatically calculated and entered in the adjacent column. If either rate is changed, the application automatically recalculates the other rate. You can update the application calculated inverse rate, but once you do, the related rate is updated. The option enforces the inverse relationship is maintained but doesn't prevent you from updating the rates."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Not Selected
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"The inverse rate is calculated, but you can change the rate and update the daily rates table without the corresponding rate being updated."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Select Pivot Currencies
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Select a pivot currency that's commonly used in your currency conversions. A pivot currency is the central currency that interacts with contra currencies. For example, you set up a daily rate between the US dollar (USD) and the Euro currency (EUR) and another between the USD and the Canadian dollar (CAD). USD is the pivot currency in creating a rate between EUR and CAD. EUR and CAD are the contra currencies. Select the pivot currency from the list of values which contains those currencies that are enabled, effective, and not a statistical (STAT) currency. The description of the pivot currency is populated automatically based on the currency definition."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"If you want the application to create cross rates against a base currency, define the base currency as the pivot currency. Selected pivot currencies can be changed in the Rate Types page."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Select Contra Currencies
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Select currencies available on the list of values as contra currencies. The available currencies are those currencies which are enabled, effective, not STAT currency, and not the pivot currency selected earlier. The description of the contra currency is populated automatically based on the currency definition. Add or delete contra currencies in the Contra Currencies region of the Rate Types page."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Enable Cross Rates and Allow Cross Rate Overrides
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Check the Enable Cross Rates check box to calculate conversion rates based on defined currency rate relationships. General Ledger calculates cross rates based on your defined cross rate rules. Associate your cross rate rules with a conversion rate type, pivot currency, and contra currencies. Cross rates facilitate the creation of daily rates by automatically creating the rates between contra currencies based on their relationship to a pivot currency. If the Enable Cross Rates option is deselected after entering contra currencies, the application stops calculating cross rates going forward for that particular rate type. All the earlier calculated cross rates for that rate type remain in the database unless you manually delete them."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"For example, if you have daily rates defined for the pivot currency, USD to the contra currency, EUR, and USD to another contra currency, CAD, the application automatically creates the rates between EUR to CAD and CAD to EUR. You don't have to manually define the EUR to CAD and CAD to EUR rates."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Select the Allow Cross Rates Override check box to permit your users to override application generated cross rates. If you accept the default of not selected, the application generated cross rates can't be overridden."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,Maintain Cross Rate Rules
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Define or update your cross rate rules at any time by adding or removing contra currency assignments. Add a contra currency to a cross rate rule and run the Daily Rates Import and Calculation process to generate the new rates. If you remove a cross rate rule or a contra currency from a rule, any cross rates generated previously for that contra currency remain unless you manually delete them. Changes to the rule aren't retroactive and don't affect previously stored cross rates. The Cross Rate process generates as many rates as possible and skips currencies where one component of the set is missing."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|3 Financial Reporting Structures|Account Rules,"Note: With a defined web service that extracts daily currency conversion rates from external services, for example Reuters, currency conversion rates are automatically updated for the daily rates and all cross currency relationships."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers,"If #MISSING appears, check that all dimensions are properly set. Particularly, check the Accounting Period, Ledger, Scenario, and Currency dimensions, which all must have a value selected other than the default highest level value called Gen1."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers,"By using combinations of values for the Accounting Period, Balance Amount, and Amount Type dimensions, you can derive different amounts to meet financial reporting requirements. In some cases, more than one combination of query values can return the wanted information. Some duplication in the calculations for the balances cube exists to ensure complete reporting requirements."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Multiple Countries Example,FAQs for Manage Accounting and Reporting Sequences
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Multiple Countries Example,What happens when I enable sequencing in the rapid implementation spreadsheet?
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Multiple Countries Example,"Two sets of defaults are generated: general and country specific. The process applies the general defaults first and the country specific defaults override general defaults. For example, using the predefined defaults, sequencing is enabled at the ledger level."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Multiple Countries Example,"For some countries like Spain and Italy, the general defaults are overridden by country defaults and sequences are set at the legal entity level."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Multiple Countries Example,"Accounting and reporting sequences are generated based on the predefined country defaults. For example, for a France ledger, accounting sequences are generated for each legal entity of the ledger. For an Italian ledger, both accounting and reporting sequences are generated for each legal entity of the ledger."

Instead, schedule the automatic reversal process to run on the last day of the month. The accounting period parameter automatically increments for each subsequent run."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,"The automatic journal reversal process creates one journal batch for each journal that's reversed. The names for the reversal batch and reversal journal begin with the word Reverses. The process also produces the AutoReverse Execution report, which prints the name of the journal batch that was submitted for reversal, along with the journal batch accounting period. If the automatic reversal option is set to Reverse and Post Automatically , then the report also provides information about the reversal batch."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,"Note: The AutoPost Journals process that's automatically submitted by the reversal process posts only the reversal journals that it generated, not other journals that are pending posting."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,"If reversal synchronization is enabled (see the next section for details), the process generates a journal reversal in the corresponding secondary ledger and the AutoReverse Execution report includes information about the journal reversal batch that's generated in the secondary ledger."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,"After the process completes, you can review the reports for any problems and verify that all journals were processed properly."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,Here are some points to consider if you decide to run the automatic reversal process:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal,If the automatic reversal option on the applicable journal reversal criteria set is set to:
"Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Automatic Journal Reversal|Reverse and Post Automatically and journal approval is enabled, journals posted by the process bypass approval. Reverse Automatically , you must post the reversal journals manually or let the automatic posting process pick them up for posting based on the AutoPost criteria set. Additionally for posting, these reversal journals are considered to be automatically approved if journal approval is enabled.","If you have an average balance ledger, the automatic reversal process doesn't check that the reversal date is a valid business day. However, the journal validation in the journal pages and the import process perform this check and, if necessary, roll the date to the next business day."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Reversal Synchronization Between a Primary Ledger and Its Secondary Ledgers,"If you have secondary ledgers, it's recommended that you enable the primary ledger option Synchronize Reversals Between Primary and Secondary Ledgers . Reversal synchronization helps to ensure that the secondary ledger remains as an accurate alternate representation of its corresponding primary ledger. If you enable this option, a journal reversal (manual or automatic) in the primary ledger triggers the reversal of the corresponding journal in the associated secondary ledger. If you didn't enable this option, you'd have to actively manage the reversal of journals in the secondary ledger, whether they were replicated from its primary ledger or created directly in the secondary ledger. To set this option for a primary ledger, use the same navigation as you did for assigning the journal reversal criteria set to the ledger."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Reversal Synchronization Between a Primary Ledger and Its Secondary Ledgers,"Note: Reversal synchronization is relevant only for secondary ledgers with a data conversion level of Journal or Subledger because primary ledger journal replication is applicable only to secondary ledgers at those conversion levels. However, it doesn't apply to subledger-originated journals from Subledger Accounting created by any of the Create Accounting processes, or to journals created as a manual Subledger Accounting journal for secondary ledgers with a Subledger conversion level. Reversals for reporting currencies at a Journal level of conversion for a primary or secondary ledger, and also at a Subledger level for a primary ledger, are automatically synced with their source ledger, regardless of the synchronization option setting."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|4 Ledgers|Reversal Synchronization Between a Primary Ledger and Its Secondary Ledgers,Here's how reversal synchronization works with journal approval when you have this setup:

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"1. From the Rule Palette, select the Allocation object and place it between the point of view member components in the flow chart on the Designer Area. The Allocate Wizard window opens and the Point of View tab opens."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"This Point of View is specific to the Allocation component, so if you have a rule with multiple Allocation components, you can specify a Point of View for each of them. Since this rule has only one Allocation component, and you have already defined a Point of View, skip this step. 2. Click Next . The Source tab opens."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"The source is the revenue pool to be distributed or allocated. A source can be a referenced account balance or a user-defined amount. For this rule, the source is the communication cost. To retrieve the cost, you must provide the account combination. You already specified values for the Company, Line of Business, Product, and Intercompany segments in the Point of View, so the only source segments to specify here are Account and Cost Center. 3. Click the Member Selector button. The Member Selector window opens."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"a. On the Dimensions list, select Account . b. Click the Search tab and search for the communications cost account."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"c. Select the account and click the Select icon to move the account to the Selections section. d. On the Dimensions list, select Cost Center . e. Click the Search tab and search for the cost center."

On the Allocate Wizard window, the default value for the Scenario dimension is Total for Allocations, which is the sum of the actual and allocated amounts. Since the source for this rule only involves actual balances, you must change the value. Click the Member Selector button. The Member Selector window opens."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"a. On the Dimensions list, select Scenario. b. Expand Scenario in the Members tab."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,c. Select Actual and click the Select button to move it to the Selections section.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"Note: If you have two rules with the second rule using the allocations resulting from the first rule, use the Allocated scenario for the second rule."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"d. On the Dimensions list, select Balance Amount. e. Expand Balance Amount in the Members tab."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"f. Since the rule is going to allocate communications cost for the period, select Period Activity. Click the Select icon to move it to the Selections section. g. Click OK . The Member Selector window closes. 5. Accept the default value for the Amount Type dimension as Period to Date. 6. Click Next . The Allocation Range tab opens. The range is the spread of values that the source is distributed against. In this rule, the cost is allocated across cost centers. 7. Click in the Select Value field in the Cost Center row."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,8. Click the Actions icon and select Member. The Select Member window opens.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,a. Select the appropriate parent value and click the Select icon to move it to the Selections section.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,Note: Always select a parent value because you have to allocate across a range of values.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,b. Click OK . The Member Selector window closes. 9. Click Next . The Target tab opens. 10. The target receives the allocated amount. Enter the account number within quotation marks in the Account row. 11. Click Next . The Offset tab opens.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"The offset receives the offsetting debit or credit to balance the allocation that was generated. On the Offset tab, enter the account number in the Account row and the cost center in the Cost Center row, within quotation marks."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"CAUTION: The offset must be a child value. If you select a parent value, the allocation rule fails validation."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,12. Click Next . The Exclude tab opens.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"Note: Use the Exclude tab for partial allocations. Specifically where you want to allocate a percentage of the total source and the percentage itself can't be entered. Instead, the percentage has to be calculated based on all the members in the basis and then some members have to be excluded from the allocation target range. For example, a basis contains cost centers 100, 200, 300, and 400. You want to distribute the source evenly across each cost center, so each cost center should be allocated 25% of the source. But you have to exclude cost center 300 from the allocation range. In this example, you would specify cost center 300 in the Exclude tab. When the allocations are generated, 75% of the source is allocated, 25% each to cost centers 100, 200, and 400. The 25% for cost center 300 remains unallocated because cost center 300 is excluded."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"13. This particular allocation isn't excluding any values, so click Next . The Basis tab opens. 14. On the Basis tab, for the Account dimension, enter the account number that has the headcount values."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,Note: The basis determines the ratio in which the source must be allocated to each member of the allocation range. The basis could be distributing the source evenly. Or you can select specific statistical or account balances for a particular period as the basis.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"For this allocation, the ratio is going to be calculated by dividing a cost center's headcount by the total headcount. 15. Enter Period Activity in quotation marks for the Balance Account dimension because the total headcount for each cost center is included in one journal recorded in one period. 16. Enter STAT in quotation marks in the Currency dimension. The values for the other dimensions are derived automatically based on the Point of View and range specified previously. 17. Click Next . The Basis-Options tab opens. 18. Accept the default settings and click Next . The Rounding tab opens. 19. Specify the rounding options in case of rounding differences when the allocation is generated. Since the allocation is in US dollars, on the Rounding tab, enter 2 as the number of decimal places to use. Click Finish . The Allocate Wizard window closes."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,Validate the Rule
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"Validation is an important and required step. Validation checks for consistency against the outline of the balances cube that it references. For example, validation checks that the offset is a child, not a parent value, and checks that entered values exist."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|5 Period Close Components|Watch video,"1. Click the Validate icon on the toolbar. After the validation is completed, a message appears stating whether the validation was successful. 2. Click OK . 3. Click the Validate and Deploy icon to deploy the rule and make it available for generation in the general ledger. 4. Click Yes to first save the rule. 5.

There may be a loan origination amount, closing cost amounts, and escrow amounts. Each of these amounts could be captured as separate lines, along with an indication of the amount type. Line transaction objects store untranslated line-level source values. There should be one row per distribution, identified by a unique line number. The primary key of a line transaction object is the event identifier and transaction object line number. Transaction details that are neither translated nor their values vary by transaction line or distribution are normally stored in line transaction objects columns, such as the Loan Number for a loan payment."

This information may not be directly from the source system or may be used for many entries, thus making it redundant. Use reference objects to share sources' information across applications. For example, store customer attributes, such as the customer class or credit rating in a reference object, and then use it to account for different journal entries in a loan cycle, such as loan origination or interest accrual. Store information, such as bond ratings and terms, and use it to account for entries across the life of bonds, such as interest accruals or bond retirement. Reference objects can either have a direct relationship to transaction objects (primary reference object), or be related to other reference objects (secondary reference object)."

Sources represent transaction and reference information from subledger applications or reference systems. Contextual and reference data of transactions that are set up as sources can be used in accounting rules definitions. Oracle Fusion Applications predefines sources for its subledger. When determining what sources should be available for non-Oracle applications, it's helpful to begin the analysis by considering which information from your systems is accounting in nature. Examples of sources that are accounting in nature include general ledger accounts that are entered on transactions, the currency of a transaction, and transaction amounts. Sources that aren't always required for accounting rules include items that are related to the transaction for other purposes than accounting. Examples of information that may not be specifically for accounting, but which may be useful for creating subledger journal entries, are transaction identification number (loan number, customer number, or billing account number), counter party information, and transaction dates. Provide a rich library of sources from your subledger applications for maximum flexibility when creating definitions for subledger journal entries. Predefined sources are provided as part of the initial data of the application."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,Automatically partition a single Accounting Hub transaction with hundreds of thousands of lines into smaller transactions during import.

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,How It Works
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,"When this feature is enabled, Accounting Hub transactions that exceed 100,000 lines are automatically split into smaller transactions, each containing 300 lines or fewer, based on a configurable grouping criterion. These small transactions are then independently processed using the suspense account assigned to the ledger to generate balanced accounting entries."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,"If suspense is not enabled or another account is required, users can configure an alternative clearing account. If the original large transaction results in a balanced entry, the suspense or clearing account nets to zero after all small transactions are successfully accounted."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,"By default, transaction lines with different values in the Default Currency column aren't grouped together in the same small transaction. You can configure additional line-level sources as grouping attributes so that lines with different values for these sources are also processed separately."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,Example:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|When the data collected can be purged by running the process. When the administrator launches the Purge Accounting Event Diagnostic Data process.,"If a transaction has 200,000 lines, all with the same currency and balancing segment value, and suspense is enabled, this feature creates 667 smaller transactions (each with 300 lines or fewer). The accounting entry for each small transaction is balanced using the suspense account. The total suspense amount across all transactions will net to zero if the original transaction is balanced. If suspense is not enabled or a different account is needed, you can configure a custom account rule to derive the clearing account."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Considerations for Multiperiod Accounting
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"To achieve a successful implementation of multiperiod accounting feature in Accounting Hub, the following points must be taken into consideration."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Determine when to raise a new accounting event
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Determine when a new accounting event must be raised throughout the life cycle of a multiperiod transaction.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If only the multiperiod start and end dates are changed, a new accounting event isn't required. As the transaction object is maintained to provide the new multiperiod start date, the impact of the change is reflected in the next multiperiod journal."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"Raise a new accounting event if the amount is changed, or a transaction is canceled after the transaction is accounted in a Final status."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If the multiperiod start date is changed after the transaction is accounted, it's not necessary to raise a new accounting event. The assumption is that all other transaction attributes remain the same. If the transaction object is maintained to provide the new multiperiod start date, the impact of the change is reflected in the next multiperiod journal. This depends on the prorate method and is also true for future journal entries."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"However, if the transaction amount is changed after the transaction is accounted; the new accounting event is needed, which affects the total deferral amount."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Tip: We suggest a detailed analysis be performed to determine whether to raise a new accounting event when transaction attributes are updated.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Raise a transaction reversal event
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Consider the multiperiod journal accounting date when raising the transaction reversal event.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"Set the reversal accounting date to a date after the last multiperiod journal with Final status. A reversal entry reverses all existing final entries, including the multiperiod journals, with the reversal accounting date."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"For example, the transaction accounting date is on 01-Feb and multiperiod journals have been created for February and March with a Final status. If the transaction is canceled, the cancellation event should be set to 01-Apr or the first day of the next open period, whichever is later."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Provide the multiperiod start and end dates
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,The multiperiod start date and multiperiod end date must be provided in transaction objects for event classes that support multiperiod accounting. These date sources are mapped to the accounting attributes Multiperiod Start Date and Multiperiod End Date for the event class. They must both be blank or both be populated in the transaction objects.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"Once a multiperiod journal is created in Final status, the multiperiod end date should not be modified to any day prior to the accounting date of the last multiperiod journal in the primary and secondary ledgers."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Deferring the multiperiod end date
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"When you're deferring the multiperiod end date, then the recognition amount has to be adjusted. As the recognition line isn't generated based on the journal line rule, the switch debit and credit option isn't applicable. The appropriate offsetting entry for the positive or negative amount is generated to offset the extra recognition."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"For example, if you're extending for 3 months and have already run the multiperiod accounting for the first 2 months, you would have recognized more than the amount required to offset; hence a negative entry will be generated."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Provide the multiperiod transaction data
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Multiperiod transaction data must be available in subledger transaction objects until the last multiperiod entry is accounted in Final status.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"At least one line level transaction object is required for the event class to use multiperiod feature. Ensure transaction objects are populated with current data for the multiperiod transaction throughout the life cycle of multiperiod, even if the transaction is accounted."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"For example, if the multiperiod start date is changed after the transaction is accounted but not all future entries have been accounted. The new multiperiod start date should be populated in the transaction object. This enables the Create Multiperiod Accounting process to calculate the prorate amount according to the modified multiperiod date range."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Multiperiod recognition entries are created based on transaction objects data and accounting rule definition at the time the Create Multiperiod Accounting process is executed.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,The entered amount value for the multiperiod journal is calculated by a formula. This formula is assigned to the Entered Amount accounting attribute on the multiperiod journal line rule.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"The accounted amount value for multiperiod journals is calculated by the Create Multiperiod Accounting process, prorating proportionally to the entered amount, including rounding differences."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Multiperiod accounting entries aren't created:
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If any subledger level reporting currency or secondary ledger is disabled, although the multiperiod transaction may not be fully recognized yet."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If subledger level reporting currency is added after the journal is created in Final status, the multiperiod journal isn't created for the new reporting currency."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If the transaction accounting date is prior to the first open period of a reporting currency or secondary ledger, the journal isn't created for the reporting currency or secondary ledger."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Multiperiod transactions are processed by the Create Multiperiod Accounting process only once for each accounting period and transaction.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,Don't modify the multiperiod start date for a transaction to a date in a prior accounting period of the last multiperiod journal in primary and secondary ledgers.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|7 Subledger Accounting|Multiperiod Start Date Multiperiod End Date,"If the multiperiod start date for a transaction is modified to a date in a prior accounting period, accounting periods that were previously processed for the transaction by the Create Multiperiod Accounting process aren't processed, regardless of the period status. Any adjustment in the prorated amount due to change of start date will be accounted in the next accounting period."

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|8 Intercompany Processing Rules,Intercompany balancing rules are used to generate the accounts needed to balance journals that are out of balance by legal entity or primary balancing segment values.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|8 Intercompany Processing Rules,You specify the intercompany receivables and intercompany payables accounts that you want to use as the template for building the intercompany receivables and intercompany payables accounts. The intercompany balancing feature then uses these rules to generate the accounts of the balancing lines it creates.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|8 Intercompany Processing Rules,"Journals lines are first summarized by the legal entity and are balanced by the legal entity. Since a legal entity can have many primary balancing segment values, it's possible that a journal could have multiple lines for a legal entity with different primary balancing segment values. In that case, when intercompany balancing is done, the lowest primary balancing segment value within each legal entity in the journal is used. After this, balancing occurs across balancing segment values within each legal entity."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|8 Intercompany Processing Rules,These same rules are also used to generate the intercompany receivables account and intercompany payables account of transactions entered in the Intercompany module.
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|8 Intercompany Processing Rules,The intercompany balancing rules are also used to generate the intercompany receivables account for the provider side of an intercompany transaction.

Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"In Oracle General Ledger, you can load budget data to perform variance reporting."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"If you use a third-party budgeting application or don't use a budgeting application, there are two ways to load budgets into the GL Balances Cube."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"Importing Budget Data from a Flat File : Export budget data from your budgeting application to a comma separated values .csv file. Use the Import General Ledger Budget Balances file-based data import to prepare and generate flat files in a .csv format. You can use Oracle Application Development Framework Desktop Integrator correction worksheets to correct validation errors, delete rows with errors, and resubmit the corrected error rows."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"Note: For more information about file-based data import, see the File-Based Data Import for Oracle Financials Cloud guide."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"Importing Budget Data from a Spreadsheet : You can access the budget load spreadsheet from the General Accounting Dashboard. Enter, load, and correct budget data in the ADF Desktop Integrator spreadsheet tool. Use this tool to prepare and load budget data for multiple ledgers and periods with a common chart of accounts instance. The list of values and the web picker help you select valid values. This simplified data entry reduces errors and alerts you to errors as you enter the data in the spreadsheet. Error correction is done in the same spreadsheet."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"The following figure shows the process flow for budget upload. Prepare your budget data, upload it using a spreadsheet or flat file, and report on the budget data."
Oracle Fusion Cloud Financials|10 Budget Configuration,"CAUTION: When the GL Balances Cube is rebuilt, the process retains the budget balances as well as the actual balances. Only the budget balances loaded using the spreadsheet or flat file through the GL Budget Balances interface table are retained. Create reports in Smart View or Financial Reporting to verify that the budget data was loaded correctly."
