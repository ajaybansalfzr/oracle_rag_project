In Oracle Fusion General Ledger, the revaluation functionality provides the following advantages: - Full multicurrency functionality to eliminate currency barriers across a global business. - Predefined revaluation rules to ensure consistency in generation of revaluation entries each period. - Usage of prevailing currency normalization accounting standards including: US Financial Accounting Standards Board, Financial Accounting Statement No. 52 (FAS 52), Foreign Currency Translation.",,
