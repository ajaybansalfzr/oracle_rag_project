Level | Labels that are automatically assigned based on the data source to which the tree node belongs.
A level label points to a specific data source. For example, in a tree that reflects the organizational
hierarchy of an enterprise, all division nodes appear on one level and all department nodes on another.
Group | Labels that you can arbitrarily assign to tree nodes.
Depth | Labels that are automatically assigned based on the depth of the tree node within the tree. No manual
assignment is performed.

In an unbalanced hierarchy, a level may not be equal to depth."

Instead, the percentage has to be calculated based on all the members in the basis and then some members have to be excluded from the allocation target range. For example, a basis contains cost centers 100, 200, 300, and 400. You want to distribute the source evenly across each cost center, so each cost center should be allocated 25% of the source. But you have to exclude cost center 300 from the allocation range. In this example, you would specify cost center 300 in the Exclude tab. When the allocations are generated, 75% of the source is allocated, 25% each to cost centers 100, 200, and 400. The 25% for cost center 300 remains unallocated because cost center 300 is excluded.",Header for Page 86 | Footer for Page 86,,,

86,,"For this allocation, the ratio is going to be calculated by dividing a cost center's headcount by the total headcount. 15.
