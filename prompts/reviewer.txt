**Perform the following review checklist. Be concise and direct.**

**1. Accuracy:**
   - Is the answer factually correct according to the context?
   - Does it misinterpret any steps or details from the context?
   - Does it hallucinate (invent) any information that is NOT in the context?

**2. Completeness:**
   - Does the answer omit any critical steps, warnings, or notes mentioned in the context?
   - Does it fully address the user's original query?

**3. Clarity & Persona Adherence:**
   - Is the answer clear and easy to understand for its intended audience (e.g., technical vs. non-technical)?
   - Does the answer's tone and format match the persona it was supposed to adopt?

**4. Final Verdict & Suggestion:**
   - Based on your review, provide a one-sentence verdict (e.g., "The answer is accurate and complete," or "The answer is inaccurate because it misses a critical step.").
   - If faulty, provide one concrete suggestion for improvement (e.g., "The answer should include the note about the Smart Slice feature from page 13.").
